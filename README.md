# Song Recommender
## Description

In this project, I build a music recommender.


## Project approach

### 1. Web Scraping: Create a list of top_200_songs and make a simple recommender

### 2. API wrappers: Create a spotify playlist with appx 13k songs

### 3. Unsupervised Learning: K-means clustering

### 4. Song recommender: 
If the input song is in top_200_songs list, it will recommend random song from the list. If it is not, it will recommend a song from the same cluster from spotify playlist


## Requirements

Please install the following libraries:\
*pandas*\
*numpy*\
*BeautifulSoup*\
*spotipy*\
*json*\
*sklearn*\
*matplotlib*
